                                <li> <b> System-level Testing: </b>Pay special attention to system-level tests that involve all integrated modules, dependencies, and services. In DSP applications, various system-level factors, such as concurrency, asynchrony, latency, glitches, node crashes, out-of-order, lost, and duplicate messages, can impact the correctness of results.</li>

                                <li> <b> Metrics: </b>Establish metrics and acceptable thresholds for the accuracy of results. In some DSP application contexts, data may be subject to fluctuations (e.g., sensor data or geo-location) and some degree of variation in result accuracy may be acceptable in others not.</li>
                                <li> <b> Non-Determinism: </b>Acknowledge that non-determinism in DSP can affect results accuracy. #G7-B brings recommendations to face this issue, such as establishing acceptable thresholds for result variations in the test oracle, conducting multiple test executions observed for functionalities impacted by variations in results, applying statistical analysis techniques to determine if the variations of the results are acceptable, and others (check details in the non-determinism strategies in #G7.</li>

                                <li> <b> Clock Control: </b>Manage the application's clock in test environments, as specialised time handling is required for testing purposes.</li>
                                <li> <b> Simulate real-world: </b>Time factors are vulnerable in real-world conditions, such as network latency, hardware overhead, and communication overhead with third-party services. Thus, the test environment should closely simulate the production environment conditions.</li>
                                <li> <b> DSP Frameworks: </b>Typically, DSP frameworks provide control functions and interfaces in their test utilities to address time-related issues, such as clock simulation and manipulation of processing time and watermarks. Consider these aspects when selecting DSP frameworks.</li>

                        <p> DSP applications have specific characteristics that must be considered during test planning and execution. This guideline highlights three particular concerns: timing issues (\#G7-A), the non-deterministic nature of distributed DSP (\#G7-B), and fault tolerance (\#G7-C). A brief introduction is given for each concern, followed by relevant observations and recommendations for associated testing strategies.</p> 

                        <div class="details" id="G7-detail" style="display: none;">

                                 <li><b> Keep in mind time-related factors during testing,</b> such as message ordering, timeouts, delays, and response time requirements. We recommend practices like controlling the system clock to simulate the production environment's timing characteristics, accelerating the clock to speed up testing, and adjusting the processing time interval to maintain a balance result precision and computational load. Test the system's ability to handle out-of-order data, a common occurrence in DSP applications. Utilize a checkpoint system to preserve consistent snapshots of all timer states. Consider tools like the Awaitility library to synchronize operations during testing. For a more comprehensive discussion on time-related concerns, please refer to Section \ref{sec:time_issues}.</li>

                                 <li><b> Don't neglect the non-deterministic behaviour of DSP,</b> which can cause the application to deliver varied results across multiple executions. Recommended approaches include the deterministic replay to identify and manage non-deterministic variables during testing and the creation of test oracles by setting acceptable thresholds for result variations. Cogitate adopting chaos engineering to check the system's robustness under non-deterministic conditions. Testers should also be aware of common non-deterministic bugs, such as race conditions, ordering issues, state inconsistencies, and problems related to lost, duplicate and delayed messages and timeouts. Additional information concerning non-determinism matters can be found in Section \ref{sec:nondeterminism}.</li>


                                 <li><b> Fault tolerance is a significant concern in DSP applications;</b> in this sense, Chaos Engineering is the primary strategy for testing fault tolerance and system recoverability. Identifying appropriate fault tolerance mechanisms and testing whether they work suitably is also essential. Common fault tolerance mechanisms in the DSP context are infrastructure redundancy, scalability of hardware and network resources, service redundancy, operation downsizing, application version rollback, operations rollback, and message contract compatibility. Section \ref{sec:fault_tolerance} provides details on fault-tolerance mechanisms.</li>
